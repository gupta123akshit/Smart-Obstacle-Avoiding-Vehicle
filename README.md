# Smart-Obstacle-Avoiding-Vehicle
 Designed an autonomous robot using TinyML principles by deploying a machine-learning model directly on  an Arduino UNO. Collected real-world sensor data and compared five ML models, selecting a Decision Tree  (93% accuracy) for stable, on-device inference. The vehicle performs adaptive obstacle avoidance in real time,
